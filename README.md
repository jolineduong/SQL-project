# Transforming and Analayzing Data with SQL

## Project/Goals
I wanted to clean the dataset well enough to be able to adequately extract the data I needed in order to answer the questions in the task.

## Process
1. Review tasks and determine which columns were required and needed to be cleaned for accurate extraction. 
2. Make temporary tables with necessary data 
3. Begin cleaning by converting columns to proper datatypes, making changes to to the columns by replacing missing values, and oragnizing columns for easy access.
4. Extract appropriate data to answer questions.

## Results
I discovered this dataset allows me to access which products and product categories were frequently ordered, and which countries/cities brought in the most revenue. It also provided a lot of insight about how much time was spent on the website as well as how many site visits it received per country/city. 

## Challenges 
I found it was very difficult to analyze the data properly since a lot of relevant data was missing. There was also a lack of unique values regarding products and their skus.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would clean the data up more. I would have done my best to normalize all of the data involving the products. Additionally, I would have studied the dataset a more closely to understand how the tables related to eachother and why the columns were split up the way they were.
